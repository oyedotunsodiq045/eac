<p>The body of Edward Johnson, lying in a pool of blood, has been discovered in the bathroom of his apartment during a Super Bowl party.</p>



<p>Johnson&#8217;s friend, Samuel Marcelle, calls 911.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh my God, he&#8217;s dead! There&#8217;s blood everywhere and he&#8217;s not moving! Please, someone help!&#8221;</p>



<p>Officer Justin Williams has responded to the scene at 124 Rodeo Drive, and, with the help of a new web-based app, you can come along for the investigation to interview witnesses, collect evidence and determine if indeed a crime has been committed.</p>



<p>This is the scenario that unfolds in CrimeScene 360, a virtual reality mystery app created from a collaboration between the School of Criminal Justice and Criminology and the George W. Donaghey Emerging Analytics Center at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock.</p>



<p>Dive into the investigation for yourself at&nbsp;<a href="https://eac-ualr.org/CrimeScene360/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CrimeScene360</a>.</p>



<p>  <a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/photos/2023/feb/21/3357720/"></a> Members of the team behind the University of Arkansas at Little Rock’s CrimeScene 360 app include Tom Coffin (from left) operations manager of the Emerging Analytics Center; David Tyler, assistant professor in the School of Criminal Justice and Criminology; Dana Fachner Tyler, criminal justice graduate student and Jason Zak, lead artist of the Emerging Analytics Center.

On a large screen on the wall is the first page of the app that shows officer Williams in front of a yellow banner resembling police tape and &#8220;Crime Scene 360&#8221; written in black.</p>



<p>The app started out as a recruitment tool for an October job fair at UALR&#8217;s Donaghey Student Center, says Dana Fachner Tyler, a criminal justice graduate student at UALR. She asked her husband, David Tyler, an assistant professor of criminal justice at the school, to come up with a crime scene story line. He reached out to staff at the analytics center in May about using virtual reality to tell the story and things took off from there.</p>



<p>&#8220;It started to spiral,&#8221; Tyler says. &#8220;In our first meeting, we were talking through all the different options and things that they are working on here. We started seeing applications well beyond what we had initially been looking for.&#8221;</p>



<p>The app made its debut at the October job fair and has been used at other recruitment events, Fachner Tyler says, and now both she and her husband are using it in the classroom.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve made a number of assignments that use aspects of it in both my Introduction to Policing and Introduction to the Criminal Justice System courses,&#8221; Tyler says.</p>



<p>&#8220;In my classes, students are walking through CrimeScene 360 and answering a list of questions at the end,&#8221; Fachner Tyler says. &#8220;They are reflecting on what the day-to-day life of a police officer might be like, how common this [scenario] might be, whether this fits with the narrative of what police work is. We&#8217;re trying to make it a really holistic learning tool in addition to being really fun and flashy.&#8221;</p>



<p>The app gives the user a chance to see what it&#8217;s like to investigate a crime scene from beginning to end.</p>



<p>&#8220;One of the things we really focused on was trying to walk the line of realism as much as we could and give students what a typical 911 call might look like,&#8221; Tyler says. Don&#8217;t worry, even though this is an investigation of a dead body, the app is firmly rated PG.</p>



<p>The scenario played out comes from notes from a study made by Tyler and informal conversations with former law enforcement officers. The app begins in the squad car of officer Williams as the user hears the 911 call and sees a screen with details about the report.</p>



<p>After exiting the car, the app takes the user into the apartment to inspect the scene and interview people there — two of whom are played by the Tylers; the others are played by criminal justice school director Tusty ten Bensel and doctoral student Darlynton Adegor. We see Johnson&#8217;s bedroom, messages on his laptop, his prescription for painkillers, what may have been his cup of bourbon and Coke as well as the chalk outline on the bloody floor of the bathroom where his body was found.</p>



<p>Along the way there are clues as well as a few red herrings for the user to sort through.</p>



<p>At the end, users are asked to fill out a report and decide whether or not poor Edward Johnson was the victim of foul play, an accident or suicide. (A &#8220;solution page&#8221; that would let users find out just how Johnson met his end is in the works, Tyler says.)</p>



<p>Officer Williams is played by the real-life Justin Williams, a graduate student and student development specialist in the criminal justice school at UALR, who just happens to be a former Arkansas State trooper.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s awesome,&#8221; he says of the app during an interview last week. &#8220;The call log, what the [interior of the car] looks like, it gives you the perspective of what it&#8217;s like to respond to a call.&#8221;</p>



<p>  <a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/photos/2023/feb/21/3357721/"></a> Witnesses are interviewed in CrimeScene 360, a web-based app created through a collaboration between the School of Criminal Justice and Criminology and the Emerging Analytics Center at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock.</p>

Tom Coffin is the center&#8217;s operations manager.</p>



<p>&#8220;A lot of our focus is doing these cross-disciplinary projects,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We can do the coding, we can do the artwork but we are not content specialists. We collaborate with researchers on campus, or in industry and government, to help them develop these applications &#8230; the whole point is to teach students how to create these assets.&#8221;</p>



<p>The plan, Coffin says, is to create a virtual experience with interesting and appealing interaction.</p>



<p>&#8220;The artwork is super important, and the look and feel of the application is our primary concern when we&#8217;re developing it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Speaking of art, Jason Zak is the analytics center&#8217;s lead artist.</p>



<p>&#8220;The goal was to put the user in the shoes of an actual officer,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We wanted to make sure that when we were designing this that we really got that part.&#8221;</p>



<p>Creating the app brought in students whose interests ranged from recording audio to coding and filming.</p>



<p>&#8220;I remember how diverse the student&#8217;s abilities were,&#8221; Fachner Tyler says. &#8220;They had so many skills that were utilized in all these mediums.&#8221;</p>



<p>The app has a lot of moving parts, Coffin says, like the witness interviews that use YouTube videos created by recording the actors in front of a green screen and rendering the background later.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re incorporating a lot of web techniques and fusing them in more traditional virtual reality app development.&#8221;</p>



<p>Academics like the Tylers and others can collect data from users of the app to see how it is working.</p>



<p>&#8220;You can track what the user is looking at,&#8221; Coffin says, adding that the information could be used for the classroom and for training.</p>



<p>Tyler says there are other ideas on how to use more virtual reality-style apps for law enforcement.</p>



<p>&#8220;One of the projects we are talking about developing would be one with an active shooter situation for officers. Putting them in a virtual environment, you&#8217;d be able to track where they are looking, what information they are collecting and what decisions they are making.&#8221;</p>



<p>In the meantime, he adds, apps like CrimeScene 360 are becoming de rigueur in the classroom.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just starting my career and I fully expect to be using these type of tools. It&#8217;s really exciting to get in and start working on it now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can kind of tell if something doesn&#8217;t seem right,&#8221; Hopson added.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That&#8217;s why said that he pays close attention to their responses and makes sure that they&#8217;re a real person before making the decision to meet up. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;One of the ways that I do is just, you know, try to follow them on some other social media like Instagram or Facebook,&#8221; he described. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He also sets a virtual date before meeting face-to-face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;You can, you know, just kind of make sure that they&#8217;re all the intentions are good. And everyone&#8217;s you know, being safe,&#8221; he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Online safety and security today, is scarier than ever,&#8221; Sandra Leiterman with UA Little Rock Cyber Security said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leiterman explained that it&#8217;s easy to become a target on dating apps and social media in general. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;With the amount of social engineering that happens, the fake profiles, the people pretending to be someone they&#8217;re not. It&#8217;s really tough to maneuver. Who&#8217;s, who&#8217;s who, and who you can trust,&#8221; Leiterman said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That&#8217;s why she recommends using the acronym: A-S-K-K. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;A is what can the company (that&#8217;s providing the app) can they access about me? If I use this app? Who will they share it with, is the S. And then the K&#8217;s are what will be known about me if I use this app. But in today&#8217;s age, we also have to know what can be known about me if this app is hacked,&#8221; she said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leiterman said that in addition to controlling your privacy settings, you shouldn&#8217;t share your location. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I would think twice about sharing my real name. And things like phone numbers, email addresses, none of that should be out there publicly,&#8221; she explained.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She also said some red flags to look out for, are people who don&#8217;t want to meet in person or that are asking for money. </p>

<p>After a nearly three-year pandemic pause, VEX Robotics is returning to UA Little Rock. On Saturday, January 28th, UA Little Rock Emerging Analytics Center will host “Winter in the Rock,” a VEX Robotics Competition of 20 middle school teams and 32 high school teams. Over 200 students will compete in&nbsp;the REC Foundation&#8217;s VEX Competition, which is the largest and fastest-growing robotics engineering platform. VEX consists of the following programs: the VEX IQ Challenge (Elementary &amp; Middle School), the VEX Robotics Competition (Middle School &amp; High School), and VEX U (College/University).&nbsp;</p>



<p>VEX Robotics is the perfect combination of STEM education. Combining mechanical engineering, computer programming, engineering design, and teamwork. All of these help increase student interest in technology and related careers.</p>



<p>In this year’s game, teams work together to build and program a robot to&nbsp;attain a higher score than the opposing alliance by scoring discs in goals, owning Rollers, and covering field tiles at the end of the match. Teams compete with an alliance partner in a series of two-minute matches consisting of a 15-second autonomous period (no driver input) and one minute 45 seconds of 2V2 driver control period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The competition’s overall winner will advance to the state championships in March.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On January 17 and 18, juniors and seniors from the Little Rock School district participated in a video game development workshop at the Metropolitan Career-Technical Center in Little Rock. The workshop aimed to increase students&#8217; exposure to relevant technology tools and languages. </p>



<p>The workshop was an extension of the Intro 360 class, a project collaboration between the Emerging Analytics Center (EAC) and the Metropolitan Career-Technical Center. </p>



<p>The Intro 360 class was launched in the Fall of 2022 to give high school students exposure to development tools and languages to create virtual reality 360 tours. Like the EAC&#8217;s 360  projects, the class centers around software like Unity, Visual Studio, and Google Drive. Regina Howard, lead technology educator, and Kimari Watson, EAC researcher, outlined the Intro 360 class and workshop. </p>



<p>For the workshop, students were tasked with creating a remote control car game. Students worked on the following game development skills: game-level design, software engineering, and project management. </p>



<p>Students designed unique layouts and color schemes for their race track and racing car. Students also experimented with C# code to add different functionalities to their game, like adding physics elements to create car movement. Students programmed their game to work with both mouse and keyboard and console controllers. Throughout the workshop, students slowly built upon their changes by following Agile methodology. In the end, students had a working game that they could customize further after the workshop. </p>

							<p>The University of Arkansas at Little Rock has created a new app featuring a virtual “Who Done It” mystery that will spark interest in criminal justice education and investigative work.<span id="more-83970"></span></p><p>The interactive virtual reality crime scene app, <a href="https://eac-ualr.org/CrimeScene360/">CrimeScene 360</a>, was created through a collaboration between the School of Criminal Justice and Criminology and the Emerging Analytics Center.</p><p>“The faculty in the School of Criminal Justice and Criminology has been brainstorming innovative ways to teach students content and skills in the classroom,” said Director Tusty ten Bensel. “With the advancements in technology, we want to meet our students where they are today in regard to their interest in gaming and virtual reality. Our partnership with EAC has been wonderful. The SCJC and EAC team collaborated and produced a crime scene investigation app that I think students will really get into and be able to learn from. We are excited to use these types of apps in the classroom to engage our students in content and work on skills that they will need in their future careers.”</p><p>The app takes you through the initial investigation as Officer Williams responds to a 911 call reporting a death at an apartment complex. A group of friends at a Super Bowl party have found their friend dead in the bathroom, and it’s up to you to solve the mystery. The app takes players through the initial investigation, including the 911 call, interviews with witnesses, and evidence collection.</p><p>Once players are through investigating, they fill out a police report with their conclusions on what happened during the Super Bowl party and identify the cause of death as a murder, accident, or suicide.</p><p>“Officers respond to reports of dead bodies often throughout their career,” said Dr. David Tyler, assistant professor of criminal justice. “So much of our exposure to how crime works is based on ‘Law and Order’ and ‘CSI’ type shows, and it gives us an inaccurate view of how this works. We really wanted this app to fit into the realism category while still being a fun and engaging exercise in investigative work.”</p><p>The specific scenario draws from a variety of sources, including a student’s time as an officer, field notes from an observational study Tyler completed, and some informal conversations with current and former law enforcement officers.</p><p>Justin Williams, a criminal justice graduate student, serves as the real-life inspiration for Officer Williams, the responding officer in CrimeScene 360. Some of the elements in the game are drawn from his 14 years’ experience as a police officer and state trooper.</p><p>“At first I didn’t realize that I would be the face of the game,” Williams said. “It’s so surreal. This serves as an embodiment of everything I went through as a law enforcement officer. Even the Dodge Charger in the app looks just like the car I had.”</p><p>CrimeScene 360 has already been tested during classes and career fairs, and the creators say the game has been a success.</p><p>“When you are exhibiting the app, you realize it has a lot of depth,” said Tom Coffin, senior visualization manager at the Emerging Analytics Center. “People are very engaged with this. A lot of educational curriculums are moving to enhance their programs with interactive apps like this that include augmented reality, virtual reality, and mixed reality.”</p><p><strong>A Match Made in Heaven</strong></p><p>Tyler got the idea for CrimeScene 360 from a mock crime scene event the university put on in 2017 with the Little Rock Police Department. The successful event, “<a href="https://ualr.edu/news-archive/2017/10/06/mock-crime-scene/">CSI: UA Little Rock,</a>” brought together the public to work with the LRPD Crime Scene Search Unit to analyze the crime scene, identify suspects, and solve the mystery of who committed the crime.</p><p>“We were looking for a way to replicate this fun event and make it portable so we could bring it into the classroom and to recruitment and community events,” Tyler said. “There is a pretty big difference between me standing in front of a classroom and describing a typical officer response. That’s not the same as the virtual experience of getting the information an officer would typically get, looking around, and seeing what you might actually encounter on this type of call. Having that individual experience and immersion drives home the reality of the job.”</p><p>A team of criminal justice professors and students led content development efforts for CrimeScene 360. They created the investigation scenario, the storyline and narrative elements, and provided the evidence. Professors Tyler and Tusty ten Bensel and students Dana Fachner Tyler, Darlynton Adegor, and Williams served as actors who played the witnesses from the Super Bowl party.</p><p>“We wanted to make this an interactive experience,” said Jason Zak, lead artist at the Emerging Analytics Center. “We took the criminal justice vision and ran with it to complete their goal.”</p><p>Fachner Tyler, who came up with the crime scene layout for the app, said the collaboration between criminal justice academics and EAC was a perfect fit.</p><p>“It all started with this sketch of a crime scene, and the EAC brought it to life,” Fachner Tyler said. “We have subject matter knowledge, and the EAC took their background in art, gaming, and programming. It all came together in this perfect union.”</p><p>The free app is available at <a href="https://eac-ualr.org/CrimeScene360/">https://eac-ualr.org/CrimeScene360/</a>.</p>						</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A UA Little Rock student has earned his master’s degree after advancing cybersecurity education for hundreds of students and teachers throughout Arkansas.</p>
<p><a href="https://ualr.edu/news/2020/10/16/profiles-cybersecurity-andrew-bomberger/">Andrew Bomberger</a>, of Hot Springs, will graduate with a&nbsp;<a href="https://ualr.edu/computerscience/graduate-programs/?gclid=CjwKCAiAv9ucBhBXEiwA6N8nYHMw1KM4U0s5XimAOadHVqLkmjq_nS3nwqLRUVwZH9dwueXRkZ4WqRoCyB8QAvD_BwE">master’s degree in computer science</a>&nbsp;on Dec. 17. While he’s grown into one of the department’s leading students, Bomberger was originally on a very different career path before discovering his passion for cybersecurity.</p>
<p>“I used to live in Pennsylvania, and my uncles owned a dairy farm,” he said. “I grew up thinking that I would do that for a living. I got to help on the farm and figured out it was something I wasn’t interested in. Around 2016, I saw a conference talk on cybersecurity and social engineering and thought it was really fascinating. I would love to be on the side that helps people configure devices, monitor networks, and help protect people from the bad people trying to break into their networks.”</p>
<p>Bomberger joined UA Little Rock in 2017 after seeing the many awards the university’s Cybersecurity Club had won. He joined the Cyber Arena project, a cloud-based cybersecurity education initiative, in 2019. The Cyber Arena provides free cybersecurity education, training, and exercises to Arkansas students and teachers. So far, more than 2,000 students have benefited from the Cyber Arena nationwide.</p>
<p>“I’ve really enjoyed working on the Cyber Arena for the past four years,” he said. “When I started, I only knew bits and pieces about programming. This has been a great learning and networking experience, meeting a lot of professionals in the field. I’ve grown a lot as a person and a programmer from this project. I’ve enjoyed helping others learn more about cybersecurity, and I hope I’ve inspired other kids to go into the field.”</p>

<p>Although his professors have tried to get him to enroll in a doctorate program, Bomberger said he is finished with his education for now and has been interviewing for cybersecurity positions.</p>
<p>His graduate project has taken his work in the Cyber Arena to the next level. He is building a cloud-based emulated red team network to provide advanced cybersecurity training for teachers and students. In cybersecurity, red teams consist of hackers who evaluate system security by acting as adversaries to overcome cybersecurity controls. Companies often hire hackers to test their network protections.</p>
<p>“My project was focused on seeing if we could automate the attack process,” Bomberger said. “It was taking specific machines that have various attack scripts and injecting them into different controlled student networks. The idea behind all of it is that it would help emulate a more realistic environment for cybersecurity training. If we can place more weaknesses and attacks into the system, we can hopefully enhance learning as a long-term goal and make the experience more dynamic for students.”</p>
