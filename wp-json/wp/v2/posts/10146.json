While he\u2019s grown into one of the department\u2019s leading students, Bomberger was originally on a very different career path before discovering his passion for cybersecurity.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI used to live in Pennsylvania, and my uncles owned a dairy farm,\u201d he said. \u201cI grew up thinking that I would do that for a living. I got to help on the farm and figured out it was something I wasn\u2019t interested in. Around 2016, I saw a conference talk on cybersecurity and social engineering and thought it was really fascinating. I would love to be on the side that helps people configure devices, monitor networks, and help protect people from the bad people trying to break into their networks.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Bomberger joined UA Little Rock in 2017 after seeing the many awards the university\u2019s Cybersecurity Club had won. He joined the Cyber Arena project, a cloud-based cybersecurity education initiative, in 2019. The Cyber Arena provides free cybersecurity education, training, and exercises to Arkansas students and teachers. So far, more than 2,000 students have benefited from the Cyber Arena nationwide.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve really enjoyed working on the Cyber Arena for the past four years,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I started, I only knew bits and pieces about programming. This has been a great learning and networking experience, meeting a lot of professionals in the field. I\u2019ve grown a lot as a person and a programmer from this project. I\u2019ve enjoyed helping others learn more about cybersecurity, and I hope I\u2019ve inspired other kids to go into the field.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_84071\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84071\"><a href=\"https:\/\/ualr.edu\/news\/files\/2022\/12\/andrew-bomberger-portrait-in-the-cave-2022-scaled.jpg\"><img class=\"lazyload\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-src=\"https:\/\/ualr.edu\/news\/files\/2022\/12\/andrew-bomberger-portrait-in-the-cave-2022-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"Photos of Andrew Bomberger by Ben Krain.\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\"><noscript><img class=\"lazyload\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/ualr.edu\/news\/files\/2022\/12\/andrew-bomberger-portrait-in-the-cave-2022-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"Photos of Andrew Bomberger by Ben Krain.\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-84071\">Photos of Andrew Bomberger by Ben Krain.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Although his professors have tried to get him to enroll in a doctorate program, Bomberger said he is finished with his education for now and has been interviewing for cybersecurity positions.<\/p>\n<p>His graduate project has taken his work in the Cyber Arena to the next level. He is building a cloud-based emulated red team network to provide advanced cybersecurity training for teachers and students. In cybersecurity, red teams consist of hackers who evaluate system security by acting as adversaries to overcome cybersecurity controls. Companies often hire hackers to test their network protections.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy project was focused on seeing if we could automate the attack process,\u201d Bomberger said. \u201cIt was taking specific machines that have various attack scripts and injecting them into different controlled student networks. The idea behind all of it is that it would help emulate a more realistic environment for cybersecurity training. If we can place more weaknesses and attacks into the system, we can hopefully enhance learning as a long-term goal and make the experience more dynamic for students.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A UA Little Rock student has earned his master\u2019s degree after advancing cybersecurity education for hundreds of students and teachers throughout Arkansas.
