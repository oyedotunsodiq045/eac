Over 200 students will compete in&nbsp;the REC Foundation&#8217;s VEX Competition, which is the largest and fastest-growing robotics engineering platform. VEX consists of the following programs: the VEX IQ Challenge (Elementary &amp; Middle School), the VEX Robotics Competition (Middle School &amp; High School), and VEX U (College\/University).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>VEX Robotics is the perfect combination of STEM education. Combining mechanical engineering, computer programming, engineering design, and teamwork. All of these help increase student interest in technology and related careers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this year\u2019s game, teams work together to build and program a robot to&nbsp;attain a higher score than the opposing alliance by scoring discs in goals, owning Rollers, and covering field tiles at the end of the match. Teams compete with an alliance partner in a series of two-minute matches consisting of a 15-second autonomous period (no driver input) and one minute 45 seconds of 2V2 driver control period.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The competition\u2019s overall winner will advance to the state championships in March.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After a nearly three-year pandemic pause, VEX Robotics is returning to UA Little Rock.
