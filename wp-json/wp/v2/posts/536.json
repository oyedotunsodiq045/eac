Members of the UA Little Rock Cybersecurity Club are creating cybersecurity exercises through cloud technology that high school teachers will be able to provide to their students at no cost beginning in the fall.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is part of UA Little Rock\u2019s effort to create a pipeline for students to fill cybersecurity positions in the workforce.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis workshop meets a significant need since the state of Arkansas is very interested in utilizing cybersecurity in secondary education,\u201d said Philip Huff, a research associate with the Emerging Analytics Center who ran the workshop. \u201cGov. Asa Hutchinson\u2019s has expanded computer science education, and now they want to expand cybersecurity education. We want to play a central role in educating cybersecurity students and getting them ready for the workforce.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Workshop participant Scott Maddox just finished up his first year as a cybersecurity instructor at Vilonia High School. He was inspired to make the switch from band director to cybersecurity teacher after Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed Arkansas Act 187, which required all of the state\u2019s public and charter high schools to offer a course in computer coding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhen Gov. Hutchinson came out with the computer science education initiative, I really jumped on it, took a lot of training courses, and learned as much as I could,\u201d Maddox said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very rewarding transition.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maddox said the most valuable part of the workshop has been gaining access to tools, programs, and activities that he can incorporate into his future classes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOverall, the fact that we are getting some really good tools to use in the classroom is a great benefit,\u201d Maddox said. \u201cThe big thing is the virtual lab environments that enables the students to utilize a lot of the techniques they are learning to defend against cyberattacks without negative consequences on our school\u2019s network. That is very valuable for someone like me who doesn\u2019t have a computer science background.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https:\/\/ualr.edu\/news\/2019\/06\/26\/emerging-analytics-center-hosts-teacher-workshop-to-promote-cybersecurity-education\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Original Article <\/a><\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The University of Arkansas at Little Rock Emerging Analytics Center hosted a three-day workshop for secondary education teachers who teach cybersecurity in Arkansas June 5-7. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":805,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[20],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.1 -
