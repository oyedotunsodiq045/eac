The credits will be used to host online cybersecurity labs in development at UA Little Rock.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Funded by a three-year<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nsf.gov\/awardsearch\/showAward?AWD_ID=1623628\">&nbsp;$276,424 grant<\/a>&nbsp;from the National Science Foundation, the UA Little Rock Emerging Analytics Center is developing a free open-source, cybersecurity curriculum for students in Arkansas with assistance from the Arkansas Department of Higher Education.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cGov. Asa Hutchinson has expanded computer science education in Arkansas, and now the state wants to expand cybersecurity education as well. We want to play a central role in educating cybersecurity students and getting them ready for the workforce.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new curriculum is part of UA Little Rock\u2019s effort to create a pipeline for students to fill cybersecurity positions in the workforce.&nbsp;Set to be launched later this fall, the curriculum will provide a variety of cybersecurity labs that teachers can provide to their students at no cost. The online lab environment, known as the Cyber Gym, will be placed on Google Cloud.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe main benefit of the grant is that it enables us to run the Cyber Gym for middle and high school teachers for most of the 2019-20 school year,\u201d Huff said. \u201cWith the $10,000, we have the ability to run 2,000 distinct classroom labs a month for six months. We are extremely grateful to Google for helping us provide these no-cost labs to students and their teachers.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https:\/\/ualr.edu\/news\/2019\/08\/28\/google-grant-cybersecurity-lab\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Original Article <\/a><\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A University of Arkansas at Little Rock professor has received a $10,000 Google grant that will help provide free cloud-based cybersecurity labs for junior high and high school students in Arkansas.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":805,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[20],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.1 -
