Something she says she has never forgotten.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI had the opportunity to learn from the people who do it,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Cruz-Neira says the technology is only getting faster and the things we are capable of doing is \u201calmost limitless.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She says she challenges her students to continuously keep thinking outside the box \u2013 or in this case, how to make what goes in the VDen box more real and less virtual.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.kark.com\/news\/web-extras\/digital-original-ua-little-rock-engineer-with-star-wars-ties-directs-emerging-analytics-center-bringing-human-touch-to-virtual-worlds\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Original Article <\/a><\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Well, we\u2019ve seen it in Sci-Fi movies and even children\u2019s cartoons, but one virtual project nearing the completion at the University of Arkansas Little Rock is showing that future might be closer than we think.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":804,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[20],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.1 -
